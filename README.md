# EvoBio2
Instructions for setting up your computer for Evolution Biology 2 course of UL

## Text editor
For some exercises you need to edit and save plain text-files. In contrast to, e.g., Word (which creates/edits rich text documents), a text editor reads and writes files that contain no hidden codes related to layout, formatting etc. For Windows-users we recommend [Notepad++.](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) Download and install from notepad-plus-plus.org. For Mac: [Textmate](https://macromates.com/)

## File compression
A specialized Zip/Unzip program may be easier to use than the standard Windows-functions for compressed folders. For Windows we recommend: [7Zip.](https://7-zip.org/) For Mac: no need to install compression software (zip is present by default).

## Java
Many of the programs we use run under Java. On most modern day systems Java will be installed already. Check if this is the case for your system. If not install from [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/) 

## Paup
The acronym stands for 'Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony', but nowadays this program does a lot more than just parsimony. Paup was written nearly 4 decades ago by David Swofford, but infrequent updates are still released. Please [download the latest version](https://phylosolutions.com/paup-test/) for your OS (4.0a168 as of this writing). Install following the instructions. Note for Mac users: there is no graphical user interface (GUI) version for current operating systems (i.e. any system younger than 10.14, roughly the end of 2019). But don't worry, the command line is always faster than the GUI!

## Mesquite
A free and open-source program for manipulating datasets and trees (not for phylogeny reconstruction!). Download from [MesquiteProject](https://github.com/MesquiteProject/MesquiteCore/releases). The downloaded file will be either a zip-file (Windows) or a dmg-file (Mac), open it and extract the Mesquite-folder to a location where you can easily find and access (e.g Program Files on Windows or the Applications folder on Mac). The course instructions are tested for version 3.81.
