## Text editor
For some exercises you need to edit and save plain text-files. In contrast to, e.g., Word (which creates/edits rich text documents), a text editor reads and writes files that contain no hidden codes related to layout, formatting etc. For Windows-users we recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Download and install from notepad-plus-plus.org. For Mac: [Textmate](https://macromates.com/))

## Java
Many of the programs we use run under Java. On most modern day systems Java will be installed already. Check if this is the case for your system. If not install from [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/)
